# CIS166A Final Project - Memory Game Project

## What is the Memory Game

This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons.

## Challenge

Match cards in less time with less moves.

## How to Play

### General

The object is to match all the tiles using the least amount of moves. Selecting a tile will flip it over and reveal the shape. If you match the tile with your following selection, the tile will remain flipped. If the tile does not match, both tiles will flip back over.

### MOVES

Moves are counted by flipping over two tiles.

### TIMER

The timer is started as soon as two tiles have been flipped.

## How I built the Memory Game

The HTML, CSS, and some of the JS were provided by my instructor for this project. In order for the memory game to function, I had to fill in the missing logic. My contributions are under the TODO comments in app.js.

This project was completed by targeting selectors, using for loops, event listeners, and other skills acquired in this course (CIS166A).
